    <h1>About Kristine</h1>
        <p> I am a mom of 3. My oldest were born in Honolulu and my son was born in Japan.</p>
        <p>My husband and I met in the military.  He was serving in the Navy and I was serving in the Marines.</p>
        <p>I enjoy puzzles and games and mechanics of things.</p>
        <p>I have played a trombone in bands, symphony orchestras, theatre pits, choirs etc.</p>
